# Marketing Agency Code Refactor

# Description
This project was completed as part of a bootcamp assignment. It was designed to address an on-the job ticket from a marketing agency requesting a refactor of their existing website to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.
The implemented changes ensures that semantic HTML is found throughout the source code with HTML elements following a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. To ensure accessibility, image and icon elements contain 'alt' atribute and heading attributes fall in sequential order.
The CSS code has also been reworked in order to make it more efficient by consolidating the CSS selectors and properties.
